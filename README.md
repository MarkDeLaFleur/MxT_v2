# MxT_v2
modification of my MxT built on an older version of android studio. Opting to use opencv4.7.0 using a shared Opencv library per the sdk's gradle.build file. There were a couple of options needed to make it compile with gradle agp 8.0. I have a separate repository for that called opencv4 that has the modified gradle.settings file as well as the gradle.build for App and for opencv4 dependency.
mainly doing this to learn jetpack compose because I want to make the MxT UI's better. The opencv stuff will be pretty much the same, unless androidx.camera has changed a lot. Also modfying the pip counting to use minEnclosing circle instead of the SimpleblobDetector.
